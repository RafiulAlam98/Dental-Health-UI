### The doctor service website typically consists of two main panels - the user panel and the admin panel.

     The user panel is the front-end interface that allows patients to access the services provided by the website. This panel is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, with features such as:
     * An appointment booking system that allows users to schedule appointments with their preferred doctor
     * A patient dashboard that allows users to view their medical history, prescription information, and upcoming appointments

      The admin panel, on the other hand, is the back-end interface that allows website administrators to manage the website's content, users, and appointments. This panel is typically designed for more advanced users and has features such as:
      * A dashboard that displays key performance metrics and appointment statistics
      * An appointment management system that allows admins to approve, reschedule, or cancel appointments
      * A user management system that allows admins to add, edit, or delete users and doctors
      * A content management system that allows admins to update website content, including doctor profiles and appointment policies
      * A notification system that allows admins to send reminders and alerts to users and doctors
      
    Overall, This doctor service website with user and admin panels is a powerful tool that can help patients find and connect with healthcare providers, while also providing administrators with the tools they need to manage the website's content and users.
